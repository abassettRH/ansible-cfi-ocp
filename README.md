# Compliant Financial Infrastructure

Compliant Financial Infrastructure (CFI) is a project that exists to accelerate the development, deployment and adoption of services provided for infrastructure in a way that meets common regulatory and internal security controls.

This repo is used for IaC, doumentation and code examples to deploy Red Hat OpenShift to meet FINOS CFI policy as defined in the [Service Accelerator](https://github.com/finos/compliant-financial-infrastructure/blob/main/accelerators/kubernetes/ocp/ServiceApprovalAccelerator_OCP.md). Contributions to this repo are made through the CFI Reproducible Infrastructure Working Group. 

## Reproducible Infrastructure Working Group [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-@finos/cfi%20reproducible%20infrastructure-green.svg?logo=slack">](https://finos-lf.slack.com/messages/cfi-reproducible-infrastructure-wg)

This WG exists to develop, maintain, and document easily consumable infrastructure as code (IaC) which can be used as a base for deploying systems in highly-regulated environments.

#TODO: add a best practices docuemnt for Ansible.

Detailed documentation regarding the process for developing and delivering IaC can be found [here](https://github.com/finos/compliant-financial-infrastructure/blob/docs/wg-readme/docs/terraform-module-best-practices.md).
